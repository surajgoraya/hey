# hey.surajgoraya.ca
### a links landing page similar to how linktree works, but for me :)

## What is this?

I wanted a central place to place links to things but I didn't want to use linktree or other link landing sites...so I decided to make this small React app! I decided to call it hey since I liked the way the `hey.surajgoraya.ca` domain looked instead of something like `links.surajgoraya.ca`. 

A little bit of a warning: This code is terrible.  

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
